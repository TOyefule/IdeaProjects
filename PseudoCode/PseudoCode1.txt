1. Create a basic application
Your 6 year old client needs an application that will receive an integer from the user banging on the keyboard, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, and display the result to the screen.

set int userInput = user input
userInput += 5
userInput *=2
userInput -=7
Print(userInput)
